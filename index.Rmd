### Why use `bookdown`?
--

- Reproducibility

???
- Of course reproducibility
  - `bookdown` means that anyone can re-run my code and replicate my results.
  - For my thesis, this is nice, but for other subjects it's *essential*
--

- HTML

???
- LaTeX only produces a PDF, but with `bookdown` it's easy to also export to the gitbook format
  - Increases accessibility
  - Improves readability on devices
  - Removes barriers to access
--

- I ðŸ’– R

???
- I wanted to see if I could
  - I like using the R ecosystem in new ways and pushing the limits of what's possible
---

## How?
--

- With great difficulty!

???
- This is a joke
--

- `bookdown` is great!

???
- Using `bookdown` is easy
  - Just write and build and the book is made in any medium you want
--

- But LaTeX templates?

???
- But the (PDF) format is based on the default `pandoc` LaTeX template
  - This doesn't conform to strict formatting guidelines
--

- ðŸ˜·

???
- LaTeX is powerful but hard
  - Getting LaTeX to play with others is even harder
  - There are multiple layers here:
  - `bookdown` > `knitr` > `pandoc` > `pdflatex`
  - Things can go wrong anywhere in the process
--

- Enter `thesisdown`

???
- A solution???
---

## `thesisdown`
--

- Thanks Chester!
  - 
--

- A wrapper around `bookdown` with Reed's template built in!

???
- The `thesisdown` package provides a wrapper and a template
  - Makes the complicated university format the default format
--

- Almost perfect

???
- It's new, so there were some bumps in the road
  - Equations
    - pandoc
  - Headings
    - Unnumbered chapters
  - Margins
    - All the different layers means it's possible to do something twice
